** Description
** Formula
\begin{equation}                        % arbitrary environments,
x=\sqrt{b}                              % even tables, figures
\end{equation}                          % etc

If $a^2=b$ and \( b=2 \), then the solution must be
either $$ a=+\sqrt{2} $$ or \[ a=-\sqrt{2} \].

* Yeast Proofing Water Ratio
** Description
This formula gives an aproximate ratio of *cold* water (from a refrigerator) to *hot* water (boiled in a kettel), for the porpose of yeilding body tempature water for proofing active dry yeast

** Formula

\begin{equation}
\frac{m_c}{m_h} = \frac{T_f - T_h}{T_c - T_f}
\end{equation}

*** Legend
- $m_c$ is mass of cold water
- $m_h$ is mass of hot water
- $T_f$ is desired temperature
- $T_c$ is temperature of cold water
- $T_h$ is temperature of hot water.
** Application
In order to make body temperature water (98.7°F / 37°C) to proof active dry yeast with, mix 3 parts of cold water from refrigerator (64°F / 17.8°C) and 10 parts of boiling water (212°F / 100°C).
** Example
To make 13 oz of body temperature water, mix 3 oz cold water with 10 oz boiling water.
