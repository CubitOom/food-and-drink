** Directions
1. If using a stand mixer, use the mixer's bowl; else use a 5 qt mixing bowl to combine the Boiling water & Cold water to make body temperature water. The goal is to have the water in the mixing bowl that you do not notice when your finger goes into the water, that is the perfect temperature for the yeast.
2. In the mixing bowl with body temperature water, mix together the yeast & maple syrup.
3. Let stand for 5 minutes.
4. Add the flour, malt, salt, and oil.
5. Beat at low speed for about 10 minutes, or until dough can "pull a window." To test, pinch off a small ball of dough and pull into a thin, see-through membrane without it tearing. If it tears, mix another minute and repeat test.
6. Cover the 2 half sheet pans with parchment paper.
7. Portion the dough into 5 ½ ounce balls and place on the prepared sheet pans.
8. Cover with plastic wrap, poke holes into the plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight.
9. The next day, pull the dough out of the fridge for 30 minutes.
10. Preheat the oven to 460°F.
11. Start to boil water in at least a 11" stock pan or wok.
12. On a clean countertop, roll a ball of dough into 12-inch long strands with tapered ends.
13. Take strand by the ends and overlap together to form an "O".
14. Pinch together seams to join.
15. Repeat for all balls of dough.
16. Let the bagels rest for 5 minutes.
17. Reduce the heat of boiling water to maintain a simmer.
18. Working in batches of 2 or 3 at a time, drop the bagels into the boiling water for about 4 minutes, flipping once halfway. (2 minutes per side)
19. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the bagels to the prepared baking sheets and sprinkle with toppings, if desired.
20. Bake the bagels until slightly browned, shiny, and firm, about 10 to 12 minutes, rotating the pan once halfway through.
21. Allow freshly baked bagels to cool
